# Amnesia Lantern Rework
A complete rework (from the ground up) of my original [Amnesia: TDD Lantern Swep](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=130745441). This is an incredible improvement over my old mod, and I think it shows well just how much passion and willingness to keep trying and improve can affect someone's work. I barely could work with Lua, much less even edit a model back when I released that addon. Now look how much that thing has changed. I think this serves an awesome lesson that people should keep trying the things they like, no matter how much other people say that your work is terrible. It's only a matter of time until you get get the hang of it, and I'm sure you'll be able to release something really cool.

Comes with 2 weapons (placed in the Lantern Category of your Q Menu). You have the choice between a lantern which works forever, or a lantern that runs on Oil (which can be spawned via the entities tab, Lantern Catergory, in your Q menu). The oil lasts up to 5 minutes, and each jar increases your current oil by 75 seconds (Not going over). These settings can be easily changed by decompiling the .gma and editing the lua of the swep and entity. 

You spawn with no oil, and upon equipping the lantern, you must left click to raise it.
